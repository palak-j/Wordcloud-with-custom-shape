# Wordcloud-with-custom-shape

Wordcloud is a powerful visual representation for text data and it is very simple to make wordcloud in different shapes using 'wordcloud' library  in python. <br> 

In this python notebook (Wordcloud-using-image.ipynb), I have demonstrated how to make wordcloud in any particular shape using an image. <br>

We can make simple wordcloud where words are usually single words, and the importance of each is shown with font size or color using code mentioned here - <br>

But if we want wordcloud to be in specific shape, let's say we want it to be in shape of car, then we have to use an image(.jpg, .png , .jpeg) and use that as a mask for wordcloud. <br>
